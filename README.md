## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lilly and I'm a Software Developer from Germany. I am passionate about coding, problem-solving and building innovative applications with tech. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Fullstack Developer at Civic Technologies. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about AI and experimenting with LLMs. Check out my projects such as my [Personal Assistants Telegram Bot](https://github.com/happyhackerbird/telegram-ai-bot) or the [Straico integration](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/23940) I built for langchain!
- ðŸŒŽ Prior to that I was active in the blockchain space, participating in hackathons around the world and winning first prizes in cities like Paris, New York, Prague, Istanbul, Berlin and more.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI projects. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about LLMs, AI agents, Langchain, Golang vs Rust and more!
